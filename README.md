# Bucket-List-App

An app written in Java that includes some activities I would like to do and some places I would like to visit. 

App contains the Main activity with two clickable CardView images that will take you to either 'Things To Do' or 'Places To Go' activities. 
Places and things are listed using a custom made RecyclerView adapter - ItemsAdapter class, that includes a title, description and an image in each item.
